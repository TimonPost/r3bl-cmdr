### Set up
<a id="markdown-set-up" name="set-up"></a>


This is no different than other Rust projects.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-cmdr
cd r3bl-cmdr
# To try our example program
cargo run
```

### Code style
<a id="markdown-code-style" name="code-style"></a>


We follow the standard Rust formatting style and conventions suggested by
[clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy).
