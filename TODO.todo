graphemes & focus mgmt support demo:
  ☐ create a POC `RenderComponent` that shows a cursor & graphemes
    - display a string eg: `Hi 📦 🙏🏽 👨🏾‍🤝‍👨🏿.`
    - allow component to have focus
    - allow component to have a cursor position
    - show cursor moving around the string (respecting grapheme clusters)
      - use JT's approach that's outlined in the README.md? or use `UnicodeStringExt`?
  ☐ implement simplest editor component (single line text field)
  ☐ implement simplest checkbox selection component (modal?)
    
support for text wrapping:
  ☐ `textwrap` crate

routing:
  ☐ introduce routing concept to switch between apps (with + without layout)
    - "in-app": shared state among all components, route in state? OR
    - "tmux style": have totally separate apps (each w/ separate redux stores, etc)
  ☐ build out the address book app (with routing) & use it to test out ideas
