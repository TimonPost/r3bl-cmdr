think about containers, containment, and keyboard focus management:
  ✔ move cursor to relative & absolute (🔱 move-cursor-rel-abs) @done(22-07-17 11:53)
    - the pos + size of a box is provided to a *component* 
    - the *component* paints itself thinking it starts at 0, 0 
    - the *component* is actually relative to the box when it is rendered 
    - add TWCommands to handle above: 
      - `MoveCursorPositionAbs(Position)`
      - `MoveCursorPositionRelTo(Position, Position)`
    - rename `Render` to `TWApp`
  ✔ add support for focus management to state (🔱 state-focus-mgmt) @done(22-07-19 11:03)
    - need to accommodate handling of focus & what is currently in focus
    - introduce trait `StateManageFocus` w/ 2 methods: 
      - `get_focus_id(): str`
      - `set_focus_id(id: str)`
  ✔ add new trait `RenderComponent` (🔱 better-box-containment) @done(22-07-21 17:45)
    - files: 
      - `tw_surface.rs`, 
      - `tw_app.rs`, 
      - `app_with_layout.rs`
    - separate the logic of painting from the app
    - take box-origin-pos & content-size as input?
    - paint things that are relative to box-origin-pos?
    - each component should handle its own input event (when it has focus)
  ☐ handle graphemes in truncate 
    - currently in `Size`, should be moved into separate module
  ☐ clean up old stuff that has been replace by `RenderComponent`
  ☐ route input events based on who has focus
  ☐ what should the specificity of input event handling be? (🔱 input-event-specificity)
    - Currently the `DefaultInputEventHandler` does not consume input events and it peeks at them
    - There isn't a way for apps to override any container defaults
    - Should this be inverted? Apps get first dibs input event & consume if they handle it?

graphemes & focus mgmt support:
  ☐ extend `StateManageFocus` so it has methods that allow access to a `HashMap<String, Position>`
    - an `id: String` is not enough to store in the `StateManageFocus` trait
    - each `id` may have a `Position` associated with it
    - this is used to draw the "cursor" (whatever that means to a `RenderComponent`)
      - for an editor, it will be the insertion point
      - for a text viewer, it will be the cursor position which can be moved around

  ☐ create a POC `RenderComponent` that shows a cursor & graphemes
    - display a string eg: `Hi 📦 🙏🏽 👨🏾‍🤝‍👨🏿.`
    - allow component to have focus
    - allow component to have a cursor position
    - show cursor moving around the string (respecting grapheme clusters)
      - use JT's approach that's outlined in the README.md? or use `UnicodeStringExt`?

add layout engine:
  ✔ merge `tw_area_test.rs` + `app_without_layout.rs` -> `app_with_layout.rs` @done(22-07-03 16:47)
  ✔ make sure to save `app_without_layout.rs` for future use w/ routing below @done(22-07-03 16:26)
  ✔ rename `tw_area.rs` to `tw_surface` and `TWArea` to `TWSurface` @done(22-07-04 20:27)
  ☐ paint state & use lolcat
  
test 2 col layout:
  ✔ refactor DEBUG & raw mode & TWCommand @done(22-07-04 20:06)
  ✔ make sure that the colors work as expected (Color::Red, Color::Rgb, etc) @done(22-07-03 19:43)
  ✔ row calculation seems wrong (too much space on top of the rendered output) @done(22-07-04 15:10)
  ✔ clean up decl macros w/ repetitions `tw_command.rs`, `file_logging.rs`, `decl_macros.rs` @done(22-07-04 20:23)
  ✔ emit clear screen & reset color commands before rendering each frame (artifacts appear on resize) @done(22-07-04 21:00)
  ✔ does margin (cols) work as expected? (different in vscode terminal vs real terminal) @done(22-07-07 13:41)
  ☐ make sure that the attributes work as expected (dim, strike through, etc)
  ☐ handle situation when cursor is moved PAST the bounds of the window (< 0 or > max)
    - add row and col offset?
    - track cursor position?
    - Example: https://github.com/nazmulidris/cli-editor/blob/main/src/main.rs

performance & completeness:
  ☐ stress test app w/ full screen repaint on mouse move
  ☐ add all the remaining crossterm commands to `TWCommand`
  
introduce first DSL (JSX-like syntax):
  ✔ implement `style!` proc macro as first DSL JSX like syntax for TUI @done(22-07-06 15:29)
  ✔ split `tui_core` from `tui` and move it into `r3bl_rs_utils` @done(22-07-06 15:29)
  ✔ replace all use of `Style` with this macro @done(22-07-06 16:05)
  ☐ write DL tutorial on create DSL in Rust
    - based on: https://github.com/r3bl-org/r3bl-rs-utils/blob/main/macro/src/make_style/mod.rs
    - create tui category in DL
    - make sure to publicize this article on mailchimp, reddit, users.rust-lang.org

routing:
  ☐ introduce routing concept to switch between apps (with + without layout)

focus mgmt:
  ☐ figure out keyboard focus management
  ☐ what does input event routing look like?
  ☐ extend state to have a focus field (current id w/ focus)
  ☐ how does this affect rendering of a layout (paint focus highlight?)
  ☐ key input processing & state mgmt (redux?)
  ☐ implement simplest editor component (single line text field)
  ☐ implement simplest checkbox selection component (modal?)

support for graphemes & text wrapping:
  ☐ `unicode-width` crate
  ☐ `textwrap` crate
  ☐ Update `tw_surface.rs::print_inside_box()` to support graphemes & text wrapping
